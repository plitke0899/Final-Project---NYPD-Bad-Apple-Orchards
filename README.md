I customized the Mapbox Storytelling template in Mapbox Studio to show police precincts with high numbers of complaints and give some history and context about each of them individually. I will use this as the base for my final project. Geojsons for multiple other precincts are attached for elaboration on it in the next iteration.

Data were based on a previous analysis I did of open-source data from the Civilian Complaint Review Board: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.litke/viz/LitkeFinalProject/CCRBDATASTORY?publish=yes#WelcomeQuestionnaire
