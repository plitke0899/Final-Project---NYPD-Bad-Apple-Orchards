I customized the Mapbox Storytelling template in Mapbox Studio to show police precincts with high numbers of CCRB complaints and give some history and context about each of them individually. Using this as a base, I then added in the stories of three men who were killed by NYPD while experiencing moments of mental health crisis, including some who called for help themselves.

Data were based on NYPD's annual Use of Force reports, as well as a previous analysis I did of open-source data from the Civilian Complaint Review Board: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrick.litke/viz/LitkeFinalProject/CCRBDATASTORY?publish=yes#WelcomeQuestionnaire
